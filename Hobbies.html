        <p> The sport I play is Cricket. This is one of my biggest hobby. I play this almost every weekend. I have been playing this since my childhood. Currently I play for couple of different clubs here locally. I am also affliated with couple of leagues in chicago area as well. </p>
        <h2>What is Cricket</h2>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</p>

            Second I love to play Badminton as well. Played this alot while I was in Pakistan. After moving to United States I have not played this sports much as it's not often played here. Whenever I get some time I always go to the local badminton place which is in Naperville. It's a fun sports and good for your whole body as you are using almost every muscle. If you play badminton everyday for one hour it's just as spending time in the gym.</p>
