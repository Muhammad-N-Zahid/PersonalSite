        <p> â€œMy name Is Muhammad Naveed Zahid, I was born in Multan, Punjab Pakistan. I go by Naveed which is my real name everyone calls me Muhammad because that's my first name. In Pakistan people call each other by Middle name as here in United States we call people by first name. When I migrated here from Pakistan my name became Muhammad. All of my friends call me Naveed and also the new friends I make after knowing them in inform them about this and they call me Naveed as well.</p>

        <p>I completed my High school from Pakistan and over there the High school is up till 10th grade I was in college 11th grade so when I moved here I had to go back to High school as here the High school is up till 12th grade. I completed my high school here from Bolingbrook High school. Then I spend couple of years in Joliet Junior College and took most of my gen education classes there. Then last semester I transferred here at Benedictine University and choose Computer Information system as my major. With the credits I have I am a junior but the major classes are not offered every semester, so I might have to spend an extra year to just take major classes or I can do a minor in any different major.</p>

        <p>
            I spent about 17 years of my life in Pakistan. I was about 3 or 4 years old when my parents started the process of Immigration. It takes about 10 to 12 years for the process to complete. In this decision I didn't have a much say so we had to move here with the parents. I love everything here but still miss home as all of my childhood memories are there. We moved here in 2012 and since then I only visited Pakistan once because of school I don't get enough time to go back. So hopefully after school I can visit Pakistan every year.
